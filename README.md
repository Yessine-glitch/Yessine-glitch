## Hi there 👋 I'm Yessine

I’m a **Software Engineering student at McGill University** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity**, systems, and building things that actually work in the real world.

My journey into tech started during COVID with a simple **“Hello World”** and a lot of curiosity. What began as front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) quickly grew into a deeper passion for **computer science, problem-solving, and security**. Since then, I’ve explored everything from object-oriented design and algorithms to incident analysis, DevOps, and cyber defense.

### 🛡️ What I’m into
- Cybersecurity & cyber defense (SIEM, EDR, SOAR, IDS, CTFs)
- Secure backend development (Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs)
- DevOps & automation (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Linux, scripting, and breaking things to understand how they work

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Cyber defense & DevOps internships (public sector & industry)
- Security-focused automation projects in Python
- Full-stack applications with **Spring Boot + React**
